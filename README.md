# Stocks_Analysis #
Green Stocks Workbook

## Overview of Project ##
	This data set holds details surrounding stock tickers our employer Steve is monitoring. This data set is a collection of the ticker price fluctuation from open to close in the year of 2017 and 2018. Our employer Steve and his investor parents would like to have an idea of the performance for each stock being monitored.

### Purpose ###
	The purpose of this exercise is to find an efficient way to capture the price movement of each stock. We want to be able to run this code to refactor all 12 stocks on Steve’s watchlist. By condensing the results into a table, Steve will be able to present this information to show the performance of each stock.

## Analysis and Challenges ##

### There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general

       The advantages to refactoring a full data set to capture a snapshot is the ability for others to easily see the changes without having to look at each individual line item. The full data set shows the opening price as well as the ending price for each stock. One single stock could have over 20 trades a day, all this data can become easily overwhelming to comprehend. Refactoring the data to this snapshot using percentage to present changes in price allows the reader to grasp the big picture. This concept can be applied to refactoring code advantages when it comes to TV sales or event ticket sales as other examples.


### There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
	
       As previously mentioned, the original data set gives us the details for each single trade that was placed for each stock. The advantage to this is the ability to reorganize this by month and day to be able to view any trends related to the time period in which the trades were made. This can be used to identify any trends related to outside factors such as the trends in the industry outside of these specific stocks as well as any new laws being placed that could impact the operation of the companies. Once you build the refactored script and see the output, you can reference the original data set to dig deeper into the questions that may arise. 
       
       The disadvantage to the refactored VBA script is the chance that some data is not captured correctly due to the formulas used in the programming. If you are unable to catch and fix the coding used, your output information may be misleading. As the data analyst you will need to be able to identify any data that may be an outlier and explain the reasoning.
